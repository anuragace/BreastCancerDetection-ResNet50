## 2. Motivation

This project aims to revolutionize breast cancer diagnosis by leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques. As breast cancer incidence rises with age, the model caters to both younger and older demographics. For women under 40, it serves as an early detection tool, while for those over 40, it aids in identifying breast cancer at earlier stages. By bridging diagnostic gaps and enhancing patient care, this project contributes to the ongoing transformation of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. [cite: 5, 6, 7, 8]

## 3. Significance

Developing a model capable of accurately identifying the presence of breast cancer in patients holds immense importance for several reasons.
