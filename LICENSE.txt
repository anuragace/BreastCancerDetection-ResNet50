Dear Anurag,

Thank you for supporting the mission of the Open Source Initiative. Your membership enables us to more effectively advocate for open source software around the world -- not merely because it provides financial support for our work, but equally importantly because it enables us to say, when we make the case for open source, that we do so on behalf of a broad membership base.

No goods or services were provided in exchange for your contribution.

The Open Source Initiativeâ€™s Federal Tax ID number is 91-2037395. The Open Source Initiative is a public charity under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
